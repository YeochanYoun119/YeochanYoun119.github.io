            <p style=" margin-right:30px;">I love soccer and my soccer team. Since I have been playing soccer every year, it has been part of my life and I was able to become a captain of my current soccer team, MAD-K, in 2019. We meet every weekend for regular practice and organize matches with nearby schools in Midwest region once or twice a semester. We also participated in intramural league and we went through to the semifinals in 2019 summer. I think the best part of soccer is that each member should contribute to the team for winning!!</p>
