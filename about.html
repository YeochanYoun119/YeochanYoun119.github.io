I was a captain of this team in 2019 and we went up to semi-final in summer intramural league. The biggest attraction of soccer is that soccer is a team sport and a team have to unite to win the game. Sharing the joy of the victory with my team is the best enjoyment in a soccer.</p>

            <p style=" margin-left:30px;">I was in Korean army for 2 years from 2013 to 2015. During the time in the army, I had to go through all training as a team and had to achieve an objective under high-pressure situations. Those times were difficult, but I was able to build my endurance and learned how to cooperate with team members. Also, when I was a squad leader I was able to develop leadership skills while leading my team and increase emotional intelligence to understanding my team members' emotions.</p>
